At first I was thinking about oppo or vivo , after that I have changed my mind into 6a. I'm very happy with the 6a. The phone is small enough to operate easily one handed, and doesn't feel like a huge device in your pocket and camera is excellent no powder effect like other phones. Overall performance excellent one."}, {'Product': 'GooglePixel6a', 'Name': 'Vivek Roy Daram', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Just wow!', 'Comment': "Pixel Has A Character! And it's gets better and better over the time! Like a fine wine!"}, {'Product': 'GooglePixel6a', 'Name': 'Siddhartha  Pradhan ', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Worth every penny', 'Comment': "Get it for the camera and experience of  carrying a relatively smaller phone in your pocket. Disclaimer: This phone isn't for everyone. Not recommended for gaming due to slight heating, just a little though. The battery is just a little above average actually. I absolutely love the form factor and cameras. It just serves my purpose here, staying off my phone as long as I can and taking damn good pictures. Software experience is the best I have used till date, however you'll have to wait..."}, {'Product': 'GooglePixel6a', 'Name': 'Shubhabrata Dutta', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Fabulous!', 'Comment': "The photos have 0 edits. Period. The phone is absolutely worth the shot. Although there is some heating after prolonged use and during charging, it gets lower with usage. Other than this, I don't think anybody cares about screen refresh rate and all other stuff like that. This phone is for people who like to own a good looking phone with a great camera and flagship level specs that are evident to the eyes. And most importantly, the size is perfect. And Google experience is the best. It's time..."}, {'Product': 'GooglePixel6a', 'Name': 'Hemin Bhavsar', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Classy product', 'Comment': "It's my dream phone and it's an amazing phone with amazing features.

I strongly recommend it to all camera lovers."}, {'Product': 'GooglePixel6a', 'Name': 'Rajat Yadav', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Highly recommended', 'Comment': 'Camera is much better than i phone.. Go for it without any second thought.. camera is superb and user experience is ultimate....Only one issue with pixel 6A that its  getting warm while using just because of its compact size.. its normal ..Love pixel 6A \U0001f60d'}, {'Product': 'GooglePixel6a', 'Name': 'YOGESH JOSHI', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Must buy!', 'Comment': 'Amazing purchase. The camera is superb, and gives so much detailing. Display is also pretty nice. Holding the phone is also perfect as it has a decent size not too big not too small.'}, {'Product': 'GooglePixel6a', 'Name': 'Tezash Sahoo', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Just wow!', 'Comment': "Pixel phones are what every Camera enthusiast desires, good colours, great night photography and natural skin tone it's all there-Icing on the cake is the stock Android experience and fluid performance (you will never worry about 60hz refresh rate)-Battery performance is really great...easily lasts a day And the whole slew of pixel specific features which I cannot less praise of - Magic eraser, camouflage, adaptive charging, live transcribe, live translation etc"}, {'Product': 'GooglePixel6a', 'Name': 'Shivam Pandey', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Fabulous!', 'Comment': "This is the same main camera sensor that Google's been using since the Pixel 2 and despite its age Google has retained its relevance by dedicating considerable effort on the software side of image processing. While the more premium Pixel 6 devices get an updated sensor, the IMX363 is a great performer for the 6a's midrange segment. While the Pixels 6 and 6 Pro came with updated a 50MP main camera sensor, the Pixel 6a went with Google's ol' reliable: the Sony IMX363 and IMX386 for the main and..."}, {'Product': 'GooglePixel6a', 'Name': 'Mayank  Rai', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Perfect product!', 'Comment': "Will be honest running an A13 beta and will suggest users to switch if they can because it enhances the device.Now for the first few days no heating whatsoever and no bugs but after 2 days I experienced the bug and heating.For some reason I don't agree with this device's opinions because everyone is treating the phone a bit under rated Yeah it doesn't have 60+ Hz screen would have been a lot better but everyone can see what Google is doing from the business point of view they would be k..."}, {'Product': 'GooglePixel6a', 'Name': 'Mayank  Rai', 'Rating': 'No Rating', 'CommentHead': 'No Comment Heading', 'Comment': "Will be honest running an A13 beta and will suggest users to switch if they can because it enhances the device.Now for the first few days no heating whatsoever and no bugs but after 2 days I experienced the bug and heating.For some reason I don't agree with this device's opinions because everyone is treating the phone a bit under rated Yeah it doesn't have 60+ Hz screen would have been a lot better but everyone can see what Google is doing from the business point of view they would be k..."}]
